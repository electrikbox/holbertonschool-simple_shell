# SIMPLE SHELL üëã

## Description

The Simple Shell project consists of build a C language program, used as a Linux command line interpreter.

It is used to provide an interface between the user and the Kernel for executing given commands.

For example, if the user enters the command `ls` to display a list of files and directories, the program will execute the comment `ls`.
## Requirements
### General

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file

### About the Shell

* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
* The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
* The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* You have to handle the ‚Äúend of file‚Äù condition (`Ctrl+D`)
* Handle command lines with arguments
* Handle the `PATH`
* `fork` must not be called if the command doesn‚Äôt exist
* Implement the `exit` built-in, that exits the shell
* Usage: `exit`
* You don‚Äôt have to handle any argument to the built-in `exit`
* Implement the `env` **built-in**, that prints the current environment

## File Usage

| Name File | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| .gitignore   | File used for ignore some file when whe push into GitHub.   |
| main.h   | Header File. Lists the standard libraries used and integrates the prototypes we need to run the program properly. If one. If a necessary library or a used prototyp is missing in the file, the program will not be able to compile and therefore will not be executed.    |
| main.c   | Creates an infinit loop which displays a prompt and reads the input typed by the user.The shell will behave differently depending on what the user types: **exit**: the shell exits. **An existing command** (e.g. `ls`, `pwd`), the shell executes it and returns to the beginning of the loop. **The path of an existing command** (e.g. `/bin/ls`), the shell executes the command and returns to the start of the loop. **The command does not exist**, the shell displays an error message
| execute.c    | This function is used to separate each word of the user input and find the path to the command, then create a child process to execute it. If it does not exist, it will return an error.   |
| tokenize.c    | This function is used to separate each word from the user input and integrate them into a string array. It provides access to each word individually. It returns the array of strings created.    |
| trimInput.c    | This function returns the character string entered after removing spaces and tabs before the first character. It returns `NULL` if the first character entered is a new line or the end of a line of characters.     |
| getPathEnv.c    | This function retrieves the full path of the command. The function returns `NULL` if the command does not exist.   |
| man_1_simple_shell    | File that recreates a man page and explains how the shell we've created works.    |

## Compilation

You can compile your program using the following command :

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
## Man Page

You can access at our man page using the following command :
```bash
man ./man_1_simple_shell.1
```
## Check Memory Leaks

You can check memory leaks using the following command :

`valgrind ./hsh`

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full \
         --show-leak-kinds=all \
         --track-origins=yes \
         --verbose \
         --log-file=valgrind-out.txt \
         ./hsh
```

## Exit

hsh  returns  the  exit status of the last command executed, unless asyntax error occurs, with zero indicating success and non-zero  indicating failure.\
All  builtins return 0 on success and 1 or 2 on failure (indicated by a corresponding error message).
## Bugs

Exit  status don't always have the good status number.
