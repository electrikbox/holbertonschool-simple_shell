# SIMPLE SHELL üëã

## Description

The Simple Shell project consists of build a C language program, used as a Linux command line interpreter.

It is used to provide an interface between the user and the Kernel for executing given commands.

For example, if the user enters the command `ls` to display a list of files and directories, the program will execute the comment `ls`.
## Requirements
### General

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file

### About the Shell

* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
* The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
* The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* You have to handle the ‚Äúend of file‚Äù condition (`Ctrl+D`)
* Handle command lines with arguments
* Handle the `PATH`
* `fork` must not be called if the command doesn‚Äôt exist
* Implement the `exit` built-in, that exits the shell
* Usage: `exit`
* You don‚Äôt have to handle any argument to the built-in `exit`
* Implement the `env` **built-in**, that prints the current environment

## File Usage

| Name File | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| .gitignore   | File used for ignore some file when whe push into GitHub.   |
| main.h   | Header File. Lists the standard libraries used and integrates the prototypes we need to run the program properly. If one. If a necessary library or a used prototyp is missing in the file, the program will not be able to compile and therefore will not be executed.    |
| main.c   | Row 3    |
| execute.c    | Row 3    |
| tokenize.c    | Row 3    |
| trimInput.c    | Row 3    |
| getPathEnv.c    | Row 3    |
| man_1_simple_shell    | File that recreates a man page and explains how the shell we've created works.    |
| AUTHORS   | File containing the names of the developers who worked on this project.    |
| LICENSE   | This file gives users express permission to re-use the code for any purpose, even if it is part of proprietary software. As long as users include the original copy of the MIT licence in their distribution, they can make any changes to the code they wish to suit their needs.    |

## Compilation

You can compile your program using the following command.

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`

## Check Memory Leaks

You can check memory leaks using the follewing command.

`valgrind ./hsh`
